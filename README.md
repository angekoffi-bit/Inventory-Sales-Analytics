# Inventory-Sales-Analytics

This project presents a complete analysis of messy stock sales data using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The goal was to clean, explore, and visualize the data to extract meaningful business insights regarding product performance, warehouse efficiency, and inventory management.

##  Objectives

- Clean and normalize messy data (mixed formats, missing values, inconsistent types)
- Analyze units sold by product, category, and warehouse
- Understand discount impacts on sales volume
- Visualize monthly trends and relationships between price and quantity sold
- Derive actionable insights for stock and sales optimization

##  Key Tools & Libraries

- **Pandas** – data manipulation and cleaning  
- **NumPy** – numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – interactive analysis workflow

##  Summary of Insights

-  Identified top-performing products and underutilized warehouses
-  Found a correlation between moderate discounts and increased unit sales
- ⚠ Discovered out-of-stock risk opportunities in key categories

##  Skills Demonstrated
